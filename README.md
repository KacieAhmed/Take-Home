### Gas fees

When learning blockchain development, you may have noticed that transactions made on the Ethereum network cost a fee. These fees are called *transaction fees*, and they are a fundamental concept in web3.

The purpose of transaction fees on the Ethereum network is to enable security and decentralization. By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, malicous users are prevented from spamming the network. Thus, cyber attacks that are difficult to defend against in web2 aren't even fesible to execute on the Ethereum network. A great example of this is how transaction fees and gas limits make it financially infeasible to execute a denial of service (DDOS) on Ethereum. 

Without transaction fees, vital consensus protcols like Proof of Work would also not work. Ethereum miners would not get paid, and several other important functions in the Ethereum network would fail. **But how are these fees calculated? Let's explore.**



## The London Upgrade (EIP-1559)

Before the London upgrade on August 5th, 2021, gas fees were calculated with the formula **gas fees = gas spent * gas price**. 

**Gas spent** is the total amount of gas required for a transaction, and **gas price** is the total amount of ether you are willing to pay per gas unit of execution. 

So if your transaction cost 30,000 units of gas, and your gas price is 200 [Gwei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp#:~:text=Gwei%20is%20a%20denomination%20of,interference%20from%20a%20third%20party.), then by the Pre-London upgrade formula (gas fee = 30,000 gas * 200 gwei) you will pay 6000000 Gwei or 0.006 ETH. 

**After the London Upgrade (or EIP-1559), gas fees are now calculated differently**. For the sake of optimization, gas is now calculated with the formula *gas fees = gas spent * (base fees + priority fees)*. 

The **base fee** is decided natively by the Ethereum network on a per block basis based on the demand for block space. In essence, the base fee represents the minimum price required to get your transaction included within a block. The **priority fee** is a tip you can pay to the miners to futher incentivize them to include your transaction on the blockchain. The higher your tip, the faster your transaction will be executed. 

Now that you understand the basics, let's demonstrate how to get gas prices in the new EIP-1559 standard. Follow along and code with us!

#### We will be building an application that displays gas fees in the EIP-1559 standard ðŸš€


## Step 1: Download Node.js

* The first step is to set up a node.js project. You can download node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

* Once you have downloaded node.js, make sure to check if it installed properly by running the following command in your terminal:

 ```
 node -v
  ```
  
  You should get back something like:

 ```
 v14.15.0
  ```

## Step 2: Create a project folder

* Pick a location on your computer where you want to store the project, and create a folder. 

* I would reccomend doing this in your terminal, because you will need to use the terminal to install the correct packages into your project.

 ```
 cd documents
 mkdir GasProject
  ```

## Step 3: Install node & ethers into your project

 ```
 npm init
  ```
 * After running this command, select the default options for everything (just keep pressing enter)
 * You should see a file called 'package.json' after running this command.

 ```
 npm install ethers
  ```

 * After running this command, you should see two new files. One called 'node_modules', and one called	'package-lock.json'
  ## Step 4: Open your IDE and create a JavaScript file.

## Step 5: Create an Alchemy node

* First go to [Alchemy's website](https://www.alchemy.com/). 
* Then login to your account and head over to App's
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KacieAhmed/Alchemy-TakeHome/main/images/Alchemy-1.png)

* Under apps, hit 'create app'. 
* Fill out the information properly. Make sure you select 'Ethereum' as the chain and 'ropsten' as the network.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KacieAhmed/Alchemy-TakeHome/main/images/Alchemy-2.png)

## Step 6: Set type 'module' in your package.json
* Go to package.json
* Add the line '  "type": "module", ' under '  "main": "index.js" 

 ```
 {
  "name": "tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "ethers": "^5.5.4"
  }
}
  ```
## Step 7: Import JsonRpcProvider and ethers into your JavaScript file
* Go to scripts.js
* Paste the following code into your project.

 ```
 import { JsonRpcProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
  ```
* These imports will allow you to use pre-existing [functions from ether.js.](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/) 
* Without these imports, you would have to write the funcitons that reterive Ethereum blocks yourself. It is much eaiser to simply use pre-existing methods.

## Step 8: Define your provider

* Go to scripts.js
* Paste the following code into your project.

 ```
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('YOUR ALCHEMY KEY HERE');
  ```
  
  * Replace the 'YOUR ALCHEMY KEY HERE' with the key of the node you created. 
  * This provider acts an interface to Ethereum. It allows you to talk to ethereum.

## Step 9: Build

* Go to script.js

We want to build an application that displays gas fees in the EIP-1559 standard. In-order to do that, we need to reterive blocks from ethereum. The best way to retreive information like that is to use our provider to get the information we need. In this step we will use our provider to give us the number of the first block and the last block in our computation. We will be finding the gas fee information for these 20 blocks in the next step. So the "last block" is the block 20 blocks before the first block


 
 
  ```
  import { JsonRpcProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/iyOKwQeJqxYftrbyCGJCZ1ias1go__jU');

async function main() {

 //Gets the block numbers for the first and last block
    const firstBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();
    let lastBlock = await firstBlock - 20;



}
main();

  ```
  
  
 **In the next step, we will be using a for loop to print out the fee information.**  Unfortunately, we can't access all of the fee information directly from the block. So we are forced to take a TXN from each block. Hence the line:
 
  ```
const txn = await listBlocks[i].transactions[0];
  ```
 
 
 The txn allows us to access maxPriorityFeePerGas and gasUsed, which we need for the computation. Although, sometimes the TXN will come back as undefined. What this means is that sometimes **const txn = await listBlocks[i].transactions[0];** will return a invalid result. In-order to combat this, we will be checking to see if the txn assignment is defined before moving on in our loop. 
 
 Once we get all the information required, we will print it out.
  

```
  
import { JsonRpcProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/iyOKwQeJqxYftrbyCGJCZ1ias1go__jU');



async function main() {

    //Gets the block numbers for the first and last block
    const firstBlock = await provider.getBlockNumber();
    let lastBlock = await firstBlock - 20;

  //prints an array of each block's gas fees, priority fees, and gas spent
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {

        const block = await provider.getBlock(lastBlock);
        const txn = await listBlocks[i].transactions[0];



        //prints the gas prices if the transaction id's are defined
        if (typeof txn === 'undefined') {
            console.log('ERROR: Txn number is undefined');
        } else {

            //get array of gas prices in eth
            const gasPrice = (await provider.getTransaction(txn)).gasPrice;
            // gasPrices[i] = ethers.utils.formatEther(gasPrices[i]);

            //get array of priority fees in wei
            //sometimes returns undefined
            const priorityFees = (await provider.getTransaction(txn)).maxPriorityFeePerGas;

            //get array of gas used
            const gasUsed = (await provider.getTransactionReceipt(txn)).gasUsed;


            //find gas fee by multiplying total gas used by gas price
            const gasFees = (gasPrice.mul(gasUsed));

            //Printing out the gas fee + breakdown
            //Sometimes the priority fee is undefined, se we need an if statement

            if (typeof priorityFees != 'undefined') {
                console.log('\n');
                console.log('-------');
                console.log('The base fee is of Block #' + lastBlock + ' is ' + ethers.utils.formatEther(gasFees.sub(priorityFees)) + ' eth');
                console.log('The priority fee is of Block #' + lastBlock + ' is ' + ethers.utils.formatEther(priorityFees) + ' eth');
                console.log('The total gas fee is of Block #' + lastBlock + ' is ' + ethers.utils.formatEther(gasFees) + ' eth');
                console.log('-------');
                console.log('\n');
            }

        }
        lastBlock++;

    }

}
main();

  ```
  
  
  ## Step 10: Test your code!
  
  Test your code in the terminal using:
  
  ```
node script.js
  ```
  You should get an output like this:

  ## Step 11: You are done! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
  * Congrats on finishing the project!
  * As you can see, as-per EIP-1559 standard, gas fees now include base fees and priority fees.
  * You should now have a deeper understanding of how gas works on Ethereum
  -----------
  
  ## BONUS ðŸ’»:
  
  * Are you interested in bonus work? Using what we've learned, let's create an application that notifies us if the gas on Ethereum drops below a certain price!
  * Now that you know how to access fee information via the provider, this project should take you significantly less time.

## Step 1: Create a new project.
* Repeat steps 1-8 from the original project. You will be making a different folder

## Step 2: Import Axios.

* Go to script.js and import axios

 ```
import axios from 'axios';
  ```


* We will be using axios to send POST requests to users who want to know when gas prices are low.

## Step 3: Build:

* Go to script.js

* The first thing we will be doing is setting up our gas limit and alert variables. When the gas of the incoming blocks is over 5000000000, we will set the alert variable to false. Later on we will make it so that if the gas goes under 5000000000, the alert variable will be set to true.

 ```
import { JsonRpcProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'
import axios from 'axios';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/Xp7IPG-NXVWb0UOa15gM8yqefzZAifan');


let gasUnder12A05F200 = false;
const gasConstant = 5000000000;
  ```
  * Next up we will be using a loop, similar to the previous excercise However instead of using a for loop, we will be using a while loop. This is because to want constantly check for gas prices and send an alert when it's below 5000000000, so we want our program to run forever
  
  * Just like the last excersise, we will be using the txn to get the information required. Just like the last excercise, we will be using an if statement on the txn outputs. This is because sometimes txn will come out undefined on certain blocks.
  
  * What's new is that we will be using an if statement to change the alert variable to **true** when the gas is below 5000000000. In that same if statement, we will be sending a POST requests to some endpoints. These post request with some data.
  
   ```
import { JsonRpcProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers'
import axios from 'axios';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/Xp7IPG-NXVWb0UOa15gM8yqefzZAifan');


let gasUnder12A05F200 = false;
const gasConstant = 5000000000;

while(true){

    //get list of blocks
    const blockLoop = await provider.getBlockNumber();
    const blocksList = await provider.getBlock(blockLoop);
    const txnList = await blocksList.transactions[0];
   
//Sometimes, txn is undefined. So we must use a seprate counter in-order to avoid trying to call a function on an undefined array element
    
    if(typeof txnList === 'undefined'){
        console.log('ERROR: No Txn number found');
       
    }else{
        
    }
   const gasPrices =  (await provider.getTransaction(txnList)).gasPrice;
   
    if (gasPrices < gasConstant){
        gasUnder12A05F200 = true;
        for (let url of webookEndpoints) {
            axios.post(url, {gas: bignumberValue.toString()})
            }
        }else{
            gasUnder12A05F200 = false;
        }

    console.log(gasPrices, gasUnder12A05F200);
    

}
  ```

## Step 4: Test your code!
  
  Test your code in the terminal using:
  
  ```
node script.js
  ```
  You should get an output like this:

 ## Step 5: You are done! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
 * Now that you've finished this tutorial, you should have a deep understanding of how gas works in Ethereum!
